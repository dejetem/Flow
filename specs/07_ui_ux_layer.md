# Flow User Interface / UX Layer

## Role & Goals

Provides the primary human interface to the complex capabilities of the Flow ecosystem. Aims to:

*   Make decentralized operations (DAGs, VCs, KG, Agents) **accessible and understandable**.
*   Ensure **transparency** into system state, agent behavior, and provenance.
*   Provide users with **control** over their agents, data, and capabilities.
*   Build **trust** through verifiable information and clear actions.
*   Facilitate **collaboration** between users and agents.

## Architecture

*   Typically a **modular, component-based frontend** application (e.g., using React, Vue, Svelte, or other modern web frameworks).
*   Connects to the various Flow backend layers (Agent, Execution, KG, etc.) via their respective **APIs and SDKs**.
*   May involve a **Backend-for-Frontend (BFF)** service to aggregate data or adapt APIs specifically for UI needs.

## Key Features & Components

Potential components within the UI:

*   **Dashboard:** Overview of system status, agent activity, notifications, key metrics.
*   **Knowledge Graph Explorer:**
    *   Interactive visualization of KG entities and relationships.
    *   Provenance tracing: following data origins and transformations.
    *   Context exploration: understanding the data relevant to a specific task or agent.
*   **DAG Visualizer/Editor:**
    *   Visual creation and modification of workflow DAGs.
    *   Monitoring execution progress in real-time.
    *   Debugging failed tasks and inspecting inputs/outputs/logs.
*   **Agent Manager:**
    *   Configuring, deploying, and monitoring autonomous agents.
    *   Managing agent goals, permissions, and state.
    *   Handling delegation of tasks and capabilities to agents.
    *   Viewing agent logs and SLRPA cycle insights.
*   **Policy Editor:**
    *   User-friendly interface for defining access control, incentive, and operational rules/policies.
    *   Simulating the effects of policies before deployment.
*   **Identity & Wallet Manager:**
    *   Managing user DIDs and associated keys.
    *   Issuing, viewing, and revoking VCs.
    *   Handling consent prompts for delegation and data access.
    *   Interfacing with token balances (Incentive Layer).
*   **Notification Center:** Real-time updates on task completion, agent status changes, incoming proposals, rewards earned, security alerts.
*   **Simulation & Analysis Tools:**
    *   Running "what-if" scenarios for DAG execution under different conditions.
    *   Analyzing policy impacts.
    *   Simulating multi-agent interactions.

## Design Principles

*   **Explainability-First:** Always strive to show the 'why' behind system actions (provenance, reasoning traces, VC chains).
*   **User Control & Consent:** Actions should be explicit, and delegation/permissions clearly presented and manageable.
*   **Context-Awareness:** Display information relevant to the user's current task or focus.
*   **Progressive Disclosure:** Hide underlying complexity by default, allowing users to drill down for details when needed.
*   **Collaborative Views:** Support shared workspaces or views for multi-user/multi-agent scenarios.
*   **Responsive Design:** Adapt effectively to different screen sizes and devices.
*   **Trustworthiness:** Clearly indicate verifiable information (signatures, proofs) vs. unverified data.

## Integration

*   Consumes APIs/SDKs provided by nearly all other Flow layers:
    *   Agent Layer (control, monitoring)
    *   Execution Layer (DAG management, status)
    *   KG/MCP Layer (graph browsing, context query, MCP details)
    *   Storage Layer (data access, sync status)
    *   Access/Auth Layer (DID/VC management, consent)
    *   Network Layer (peer status, connection info)
    *   Coordination Layer (shared state visualization)
    *   Incentive Layer (balances, reputation, bounties)

## Extensibility

*   Support for **pluggable UI components** or modules.
*   Allowing for **custom dashboards** tailored to specific use cases or roles.
*   **Theming** capabilities.
*   Potential for integration with external data analysis or visualization tools.

## APIs & SDKs (Consumed & Provided)

*   **Consumes:** APIs/SDKs from backend layers.
*   **Provides (Potentially):**
    *   A library of reusable UI components embodying Flow concepts (Graph nodes, DAG steps, VC viewers).
    *   Design system guidelines.
    *   A BFF service API if implemented.
