# Flow Coordination & Sync Layer

## Design Goals

*   **Local-first Consistency:** Ensure data is consistent locally and synchronizes efficiently.
*   **Conflict-Free Replication:** Utilize CRDTs to handle concurrent updates automatically.
*   **Context-Aware Sync:** Synchronize data relevant to specific tasks or collaborations.
*   **Semantic DAG Coordination:** Manage the distributed state of DAG execution.
*   **Multi-Agent Orchestration:** Facilitate complex interactions between agents based on shared state.
*   **Offline Resilience:** Support operation during network disconnection and seamless re-sync.
*   **Privacy-Respecting:** Allow selective synchronization based on permissions (VCs).
*   **Decentralized:** Avoid reliance on central servers for state coordination.
*   **Extensible:** Allow different sync strategies and protocols.
*   **Verifiable Sync:** Ensure synchronized state is authentic and authorized.

## Core Mechanisms

*   **CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types):** The foundation for state management.
    *   Utilizes standard CRDT types (LWW-Register/Map, OR-Set, Sequence CRDTs like RGA/OpSet) provided via libraries (e.g., Any-Sync, go-ds-crdt).
    *   Changes are represented as **signed, content-addressed deltas** (or operations) often structured within DAGs.
    *   Provide **deterministic merge semantics** ensuring eventual consistency.
*   **Sync DAGs:** Structure representing the evolution of shared state or tasks.
    *   Nodes in the DAG can represent CRDT objects, tasks, events, or deltas.
    *   Edges represent causal dependencies (e.g., one delta depends on another).
    *   **Incremental Sync:** Peers exchange deltas based on their current known state (DAG frontiers or version vectors) to efficiently converge.
    *   **State Reconciliation:** Merging DAG structures and applying CRDT merge logic.

## Task Lifecycle Synchronization

*   Manages the distributed state transitions of tasks within the Execution Layer's DAGs.
*   Uses a distributed state machine model, where states might include: `Proposed`, `Offered`, `Accepted`, `InProgress`, `Completed`, `Failed`, `Rejected`.
*   **State Transitions as CRDT Deltas:** Each transition is recorded as a delta applied to the task's state object (which is itself a CRDT).
*   **Conflict Handling:** Strategies for resolving conflicting transitions (e.g., based on VC scope, timestamps, policy rules, or potentially requiring agent intervention).

## Workspace & Context Synchronization

*   Manages shared environments like collaborative documents, knowledge graph partitions, or shared agent context.
*   Uses CRDT DAGs to represent the history and current state of these workspaces.
*   **Selective/Scoped Sync:** Leverages VCs to control which parts of a workspace are synced with which peers, ensuring privacy and relevance.
*   Enables real-time collaboration between users and agents.
*   Supports reactive agent behavior based on changes in shared context.

## Versioning & Snapshots

*   **Inherent Versioning:** The history of CRDT deltas and the Sync DAG structure provide a complete version history.
*   **Immutable Snapshots:** Ability to create content-addressed, immutable snapshots of the state at a specific point in the DAG history.
*   **Checkpoints:** Snapshots can serve as checkpoints for recovery or efficient state transfer.
*   Supports branching and merging of state histories (inherent in DAG/CRDT model).

## Agent Coordination Patterns

*   Defines standard patterns for multi-agent interaction built upon shared DAG state and VCs:
    *   **Task Handoff:** Transferring responsibility for a task between agents.
    *   **Constraint Resolution:** Collaborative problem-solving based on shared constraints.
    *   **Delegation:** Agents issuing VCs to authorize other agents.
    *   **Timed Orchestration:** Coordinating actions based on time or event triggers in the shared state.
    *   **Fork-Merge:** Agents working on parallel branches of a task/state and merging results.
*   Roles (Planner, Executor, Monitor) interact via changes to shared CRDT/DAG state.

## Offline Support & Resilience

*   **Full Offline Operation:** Agents/users can continue to modify local CRDT state while disconnected.
*   **Queued Deltas:** Locally generated changes are queued as deltas.
*   **Rehydration & Sync:** Upon reconnection:
    *   Peers exchange DAG frontiers/version vectors.
    *   Relevant missing deltas are exchanged (via Network Layer).
    *   Deltas are replayed and CRDT states are merged deterministically.
*   Preserves data integrity and VC capabilities during offline periods.

## Extensibility

*   **Pluggable Sync Strategies:** Allows customization of:
    *   Sync protocols (e.g., gossip-based, request-response).
    *   Filtering logic (what data to sync based on context/policy).
    *   Merge conflict resolution overrides (if needed beyond standard CRDT logic).
    *   Peer selection strategies.
    *   Policy enforcement during sync.

## Integration

*   **Storage Layer:** Relies on the Storage Layer for persisting CRDT state and deltas.
*   **Network Layer:** Uses the Network Layer for discovering peers and transporting sync messages/deltas.
*   **Execution Layer:** Synchronizes the state of DAGs and tasks.
*   **KG Layer:** The objects being synchronized are often nodes/subgraphs within the Knowledge Graph.
*   **Access & Auth Layer:** VCs gate all sync operations and define data visibility.
