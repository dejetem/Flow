# Flow Incentive Layer

## Role & Goals

Provides the economic and reputational foundation for decentralized coordination within the Flow ecosystem. Aims to:

*   Align utility, contribution, and behavior with value and system goals.
*   Enable fine-grained attribution of value creation.
*   Support diverse economic models (native/external tokens, reputation, access).
*   Ensure verifiability, fairness, transparency, and fraud resistance.
*   Reward both human and agent contributions appropriately.
*   Integrate natively with Flow's coordination substrate (DAGs, CRDTs, Proofs).
*   Prevent centralization of economic power.
*   Respect user privacy and consent.
*   Foster sustainable and motivating economic ecosystems.

## Philosophy

*   **Pluralistic and Composable:** Not a single, monolithic token economy. Allows communities, agents, and applications to define custom incentive logic.
*   **Modular Plugins:** Incentive rules and mechanisms implemented via pluggable modules (e.g., WASM, function registries, smart contracts).
*   **Blending Financial & Non-Financial:** Recognizes and integrates both monetary (tokens, bounties) and non-monetary (reputation, access, governance rights) incentives.

## Architecture & Components

Core components may include:

*   **Contribution Tracking Engine:** Logs valuable actions based on verifiable provenance data from KG and Execution Layer.
*   **Reputation Management System:** Calculates and updates contextual reputation scores based on contributions, attestations, and behavior.
*   **Reward Distribution Engine:** Allocates tokens, reputation points, or other incentives based on defined policies and tracked contributions.
*   **Policy Engine:** Defines and evaluates the rules governing rewards, penalties, and reputation adjustments.
*   **Value Flow Router:** Directs value based on provenance and multi-party workflow policies.
*   **Instrument Adapters/Bridges:** Interface with various economic instruments (native/external tokens, NFTs).

## Value Flows & Roles

*   Defines multi-directional value flows associated with key activities:
    *   Knowledge Creation/Curation
    *   Computation & Verification
    *   Data Provision & Stewardship
    *   Storage Provision
    *   Task Orchestration & Coordination
    *   Validation & Review
    *   Sponsorship & Funding
*   Maps value flows to economic **Roles** within the ecosystem (potentially composable):
    *   Contributor (Knowledge, Data, Code)
    *   Agent Maintainer/Developer
    *   Compute Provider
    *   Storage Provider
    *   Data Steward
    *   Reviewer/Validator
    *   Coordinator/Orchestrator
    *   Sponsor/Funder
    *   Relay Operator
*   Incentives follow the contribution graph, allowing value to be shared across roles in complex workflows.

## Contribution Types & Metrics

*   Identifies and measures various contribution types:
    *   Knowledge Graph Edits (creation, linking, annotation)
    *   Task Execution (completion, quality, efficiency)
    *   Model Inference/Training (accuracy, resource use)
    *   Data Provision (quality, uniqueness, consent)
    *   Validation/Review Actions
    *   Delegation of Capabilities (VCs)
    *   Sync/Relay Services
    *   Governance Participation
    *   Tooling & Infrastructure Development
*   Metrics considered:
    *   Frequency, Quantity
    *   Quality, Utility, Impact (potentially assessed via feedback/attestation)
    *   Scope, Complexity
    *   Originality, Novelty
    *   Verification/Proof Attached
    *   Timeliness
    *   Stake/Risk Involved
*   Metrics should be verifiable, attributable, resistant to gaming, and contextually weighted.

## Attribution & Provenance

*   Leverages Flow's core provenance capabilities:
    *   Signed, content-addressed DAG nodes (tasks, data, messages).
    *   Signed CRDT deltas.
    *   VC chains for delegation and action authorization.
    *   Task receipts and execution proofs (ZK, TEE).
    *   Peer witnessing or attestations.
*   Enables fine-grained tracking of who contributed what, when, and under what authority.
*   Supports different granularities (fine, medium, coarse) and privacy-preserving attribution (ZKPs).

## Reward Mechanisms

Supports a variety of programmable reward distribution models:

*   **Task-Based:** Triggered by lifecycle events (e.g., completion, verification). Bounties.
*   **Graph-Based Attribution:** Weighted distribution based on contribution provenance graph.
*   **Streaming/Usage-Based:** Micropayments for continuous services (compute, storage, data streams).
*   **Verification/Attestation Rewards:** Incentives for validating work or data.
*   **Escrowed/Conditional Rewards:** Released upon meeting specific conditions.
*   **Staked/Delegated Rewards:** Earning yield for securing services or delegating stake.
*   **Retroactive Funding / DAO-Governed:** Community-based allocation (e.g., quadratic funding, grants).
*   **Reputation-Gated Rewards:** Access to rewards requires minimum reputation score.
*   Distribution relies on provenance data, VCs, receipts, and configurable policy modules.

## Incentive Instruments

Supports multiple forms of value representation:

*   **Native Tokens/Credits:** Platform-specific utility or governance tokens.
*   **External Tokens:** Integration with existing cryptocurrencies via bridges/adapters.
*   **Staking Collateral:** Tokens locked to secure services or guarantee performance.
*   **Access Tokens/Keys:** Non-transferable rights to use specific services/data.
*   **Reputation Credits:** Non-fungible or semi-fungible scores influencing status and rewards.
*   **NFT Credentials/Badges:** Representing achievements, roles, or completed contributions.
*   **Vouchers/IOUs:** Off-chain promises or claims on future value.
*   **Governance Tokens:** Conferring voting rights in DAOs or policy decisions.
*   Instruments are designed to be composable, verifiable, decentralized, consent-based, and linked to workflows.

## Integration

Deeply integrated with other layers:

*   **KG/Provenance:** Source of truth for contribution tracking.
*   **Execution Layer:** Triggers reward events based on task completion/verification.
*   **Compute/Storage Layers:** Facilitates payments for resource usage.
*   **Access & Auth Layer:** Links rewards/reputation to DIDs, uses VCs for disbursement authorization.
*   **Coordination Layer:** Synchronizes reward-related state (balances, reputation scores).
*   **UI/UX Layer:** Visualizes reputation, balances, bounties, contribution history.

## APIs & SDKs

Provides interfaces (SDKs, CLI: `flow incentive`) for:

*   Querying reputation scores.
*   Defining and managing bounties/tasks.
*   Checking token balances or credit status.
*   Configuring and deploying incentive policies.
*   Auditing reward flows and contribution history.
